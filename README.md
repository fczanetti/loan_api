# Loan API

Welcome to Loan API. 

This is an API that can be used to manage loans from banks to clients. The clients, once authenticated, are able to create, read, update and delete their loans. When creating a new loan, the client/user has to inform the value, interest rate and the bank responsible for loaning the money. Users can also insert payments to their loans informing the loan, payment date and value.

When retrieving a loan, users can also view how much they still own to the bank, and this value is calculated based on the interest rate informed when creating the loan, how much was already paid and how long ago the loan was created.

**This API is still in construction, and more details will be inserted in the future.**

You can check the project instructions/requirements [on this link](https://github.com/fczanetti/loan_api/blob/main/project_instructions.md). 

Or, if you prefer, you can also check [the original repository](https://github.com/onidata/vagas).
